### Be respectful and inclusive

We encourage participation from everyone. Please be respectful and considerate towards others, and avoid any language, images, or actions that could be considered disrespectful, offensive, or exclusionary.

### Listen and be open to constructive feedback

Be open to constructive feedback and criticism from others. We all have room to learn, grow, and improve, and being open to feedback is an important part of that process.

### Don't harass or discriminate

Harassment or discrimination of any kind will not be tolerated. This includes but is not limited to derogatory comments or slurs, sexual harassment, and unwanted physical contact or attention. If you experience or witness any form of harassment or discrimination, please report it immediately.
