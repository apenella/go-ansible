# Example ansibleplaybook-ssh

This example demonstrates how to use `go-ansible` to run an Ansible playbook on a remote host using SSH.

The example provides a `Makefile` to build and run the example. The `Makefile` includes the following targets:

- `build`: Builds the containers to run the example
- `run`: Runs the example
- `up`: Starts the environment
- `down`: Stops the environment
- `restart`: Restarts the environment
