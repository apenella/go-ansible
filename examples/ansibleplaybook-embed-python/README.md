# Ansible Playbook Embed Python

> **Disclaimer**: This example demonstrates how to use `go-ansible` library along with the `go-embed-python` solution. While this is not a feature of the library itself, its compatibility with various Ansible playbooks could vary depending on the requirements of the playbook. However, it serves as a source of inspiration for creating your solution.

  - [Considerations](#considerations)
  - [Run the example](#run-the-example)

## Considerations

This example does not include the `go-embed-python` packages within the `data` folder. You need to install them manually by running the following command:

```sh
go generate ./...
```

As a result, the `data` folder will be created with the embedded Python packages.

## Run the example

This example provides a Dockerfile that encapsulates all the necessary steps to generate the embedded Python packages, create a Go binary containing the Ansible playbook, and the embedded Python packages.

The example installs the `ansible-core` package. That is the minimal package required to run the Ansible playbook embedded in the Go binary. You can include additional packages by adding them to the `internal/ansibleplaybook-embed-python/requirements.txt` file.

The Ansible playbook used in this example is defined in the `resources/ansible/site.yml` file. When the application is executed, the playbook is unpacked from the Go binary into a temporary directory. The embedded Python packages are also unpacked into another temporary directory. The playbook is then executed using the embedded Python interpreter.

You can run the example with the following command:

```sh
$ make run
